# Working With Historical Maps

This repository contains the material connected to a workshop developed for CDCS by **Ian Holmes** [Edina](https://edina.ac.uk/) .
This workshop shows how to work with Historical Maps and Digimaps.

Maps are used by researchers in many different fields and more and more map collections are being digitised and made available online. Contemporary mapping technologies afford lots of new opportunities to work with maps, but using historical maps often means working without geolocation data and GIS.

This workshop explored the potential of historical maps for research, the issues and challenges that historic maps present, and how one can make the most out of the mapping resources that the University of Edinburgh provides access to.
